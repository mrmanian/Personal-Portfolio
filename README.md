# [Personal Portfolio](https://mrmanian.herokuapp.com/)

I created a portfolio website from scratch using Flask and by implementing HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 4 for styling and designing page content. This website is hosted by Heroku.  

Website has been tested and is fully functional in the following browsers:  
--Google Chrome  
--Internet Explorer  
--Microsoft Edge  
--Firefox  
--Opera  
--Safari  

Website has been tested in the most commonly used screen aspect ratios:  
--4:3  
--16:9  
--16:10  


Website is functional in mobile devices and tablets (android and ios). Note that Apple does not support the font style Comic Sans used in my website so it defaults to Arial. Particles.js animation unavailable on mobile devices.
